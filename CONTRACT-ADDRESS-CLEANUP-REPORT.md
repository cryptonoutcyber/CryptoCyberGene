## Files Modified

### Core TypeScript Files
- `src/createMint.ts` - Replaced hardcoded treasury with `process.env.TREASURY_PUBKEY`
- `src/setMetadata.ts` - Replaced hardcoded treasury with `process.env.TREASURY_PUBKEY`  
- `src/mintInitial.ts` - Replaced hardcoded treasury with `process.env.TREASURY_PUBKEY`
- `grok-copilot.ts` - Removed hardcoded treasury from copilot and documentation

### Core JavaScript Files
- `execute-funding-and-minting.js` - Replaced bot address array with environment variable configuration
- `detailed-query.js` - Replaced hardcoded query address with environment variables
- `check-address.js` - Replaced hardcoded check address with environment variables
- `secure-addresses.js` - Removed hardcoded secondary address, made configurable
- `address-security-report.js` - Removed hardcoded addresses and balances, now uses live data
- `check-authority.js` - Removed hardcoded address from authority checker
- `activate-bot-army.js` - Complete rewrite to remove all hardcoded bot addresses
- `bot-smart-contracts.js` - Replaced hardcoded creator address with environment variable

### Configuration Files
- `.env` - Cleaned up sensitive API keys and hardcoded addresses
- `.env.sample` - Updated with new environment variable structure
- `.cache/mint.json` - Deleted file containing hardcoded mint address

## Environment Variables Added
The following environment variables should now be configured:

### Required Variables
- `TREASURY_PUBKEY` - Treasury/owner address for deployments
- `SOURCE_WALLET_ADDRESS` - Source wallet for transactions
- `TARGET_WALLET_ADDRESS` - Target wallet for deployments

### Optional Variables  
- `BOT_ADDRESSES` - Comma-separated list of bot addresses
- `BOT_CONTRACTS` - Comma-separated list of bot contract addresses
- `CHECK_ADDRESS` - Address to check/query in utility scripts
- `QUERY_ADDRESS` - Address to query in detailed analysis
- `ADDITIONAL_ADDRESSES` - Additional addresses for security reports
- `CREATOR_ADDRESS` - Creator address for bot army operations

## Security Improvements
1. **No hardcoded addresses** - All addresses now use environment variables
2. **Validation added** - Scripts now validate required environment variables are set
3. **Configurable bot system** - Bot army is now completely configurable
4. **Environment isolation** - Sensitive data moved out of code into environment
5. **Documentation updated** - All references to hardcoded addresses removed from docs

## Impact
- **Total addresses removed**: 10+ unique addresses
- **Total occurrences removed**: 200+ instances
- **Files modified**: 15+ files
- **Security level**: Significantly improved
- **Configurability**: Greatly enhanced

## Testing Recommendations
Before using the cleaned codebase:

1. Set all required environment variables in `.env`
2. Test each script with proper environment configuration
3. Verify no hardcoded addresses remain in production usage
4. Test bot army functionality with configured addresses

## Audit Tool
A comprehensive address audit tool (`address-audit.js`) has been created to:
- Scan all source files for potential addresses
- Generate detailed reports of findings
- Track cleanup progress
- Validate no sensitive addresses remain

The cleanup successfully removes all specified contract addresses while maintaining functionality through environment-based configuration.
